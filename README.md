# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
An Colorado Board of Elections employee assigned the tasks below to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1.	Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
-	Data Source: election_results.csv
-	Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The election analysis show that:
-	There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
-	The candidates were 


     1. Charles Casper Stockham  
     2. Diana DeGette
     3. Raymon Anthony Doane


-	The candidate results were:


    1. Charles Casper received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
	  2. Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    3. Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% and 11,606 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The challenge was to audit and report the total number of votes cast in the congressional elections using Python. Python was expected to automate the audit process and determine the winning candidate and county. The total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote was determined using Python in the audit.


## Challenge Summary
Overall, the code was successfull in auditing the election votes and providing the required results based on wining candidate and county! The python tool is very fast, powerful, reliable and able to analyze a big data set to get the desired results in a very short time! The Electoral Commission can enjoy the numerous benefts this tool has to offer. As we can see, it automated the whole data analysis using Python versus the traditional excel and quickly analyzed the voting data from all 3 voting methods. It has the added benefit of minimizing doubts and delivering time sensitive decisions in promptly. The code was successful in certifying the winner of the election quickly.
Diana DeGette was the winning candidate and received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 number of votes. Denver was the winning county with 82.8% of the votes. The total votes cast was 369,711. This script can be modified to obtain how males and females voted as well as demographics of voters in other elections. The code as demonstrated can be used to audit not only other congressional districts, but also senatorial districts and local elections.
